#Importing Existing maven projects in various IDEs

## Netbeans
To open a maven project in netbeans you can either open your project folder (the one containing the POM.xml) directly as a project with the `File > Open Project ...` menu
or
you can create a new project, select the Maven category, and choose "Project with Existing POM" - which then prompts you to select the project folder.
